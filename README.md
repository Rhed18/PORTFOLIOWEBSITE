## Portfolio-Website
This portfolio website is designed for educational purposes and serves as a project fulfillment for our Web System course. It features 8 distinct sections, though the required number is at least 6, each carefully crafted to reflect a unique coffee-themed design. The website is fully responsive and accessible, ensuring that it can be opened on any platform, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. This project represents a blend of creativity and technical skills, and I am excited to share it as part of my journey in the world of web development.
